# FantasyFootballDraftClient
A qt developed fantasy football draft client developed by Chris Klammer

This is a project that I will likely continue to develop each year. I decided to start this project because I got tired of paying for fantasy football software and it would be a good way to test some of my skills. I started this project on August 14th and worked on it until August 20th, working around 5-8 hours a day. I will enter into a log via this file each time I work on the project throughout the years and will likely make it public if I decide to discontinue work on it.
